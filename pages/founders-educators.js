                You are the subject matter expert. But you don't have time to be a full-time creator. GapGens bridges that gap.
            </p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                You find yourself explaining the same concepts over and over—on sales calls, in slack, in coaching sessions. You know you should "write it down once," but staring at a blank page is paralyzed.
            </p>

            <h2>How GapGens Helps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rant to Resource:</strong> Record a focused 5-minute Loom video explaining a concept. GapGens turns it into a polished detailed guide.</li>
                <li><strong>Course Creation:</strong> Analyze your existing webinars. Find where students get stuck (the gaps). Generate improved scripts for those lessons.</li>
                <li><strong>Sales Enablement:</strong> Turn technical product walkthroughs into clear one-pagers for your sales team.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Authority is leverage.</strong> By capturing your knowledge and distributing it effectively, you clone yourself. GapGens is the cloning machine for your intellectual property.
