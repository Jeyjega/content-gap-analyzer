                The biggest bottleneck in scaling a YouTube channel isn't filming; it's writing. GapGens unblocks your scripting process.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                You have the idea, but turning that idea into a 10-minute script that retains viewers is grueling. Or, you've done a 2-hour live stream that has gold in it, but editing it down is a full-time job.
            </p>

            <h2>How GapGens Helps</h2>
            <p>
                GapGens acts as your <strong>Script Doctor</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brain Dump → Script:</strong> Record a voice memo rambling about your topic. Upload it. GapGens organizes your chaos into a structured script.</li>
                <li><strong>Live Stream Repurposing:</strong> Analyze your stream. Identify the 3 best segments. Generate standalone scripts for 3 new videos.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention Check:</strong> Run your draft script through our analysis. We flag boring sections and logic gaps that kill retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Consistency wins on YouTube. By reducing the friction of writing, you can publish higher quality videos more frequently without burnout.
